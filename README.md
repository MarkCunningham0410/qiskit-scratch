# qiskit-scratch - Experimenting with Qiskit

Hello! If you're reading this you're probably interested in Quantum Computing.
This is my repository for posting work as I go through tutorials provided by IBM.
Personally I am enjoying their Youtube series and the community textbook.
If you're interested in working together - gimme a shout!
