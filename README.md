# qiskit-scratch - Experimenting with Qiskit

Hello! If you're reading this you're probably interested in Quantum Computing.
This is my repository for posting work as I go through tutorials provided by IBM Q for the Qiskit Python Framework.

I'm a beginner to Quantum Computing but I find Qiskit very beginner friendly.

If you're interested in working together - gimme a shout!
